<!-- Why do I want to learn this skill?
  So for first reason, I know that software development is one of the well paid and a demanding job in all of the world. I think I can have achieve more in life by learning how to Code and become successful developer/ designer.
  Second reason is I believe I'm good at it, I just need to advanced. Its a challenging job which I like it cause every day of every month I need to learn a new stuff. I never thought that I work as an employee in an office, but I guess its the only option I have, in that case a developer gets more money than a designer. By becoming a developer I can apply for other countries more easily than a designer.

What will achieve if I learn this skill?
  I can shift my career to a developer. earn more money. A better work life. Never afraid of losing a job. also getting more stress.

How will this skill change my life and my career?
  If I can make more money I'll have a better life, provides more for my family and my self. Never lose job and become jobless cause developers are in demands so much. I can apply for abroad. I can become more expert in my field.

How will learning this skill impact the lives of my family?
  for instance I can help them more, provide more for my lovely Aban, and my kids. I can help my mother and father. I can have a more serious job and they think of me better. I believe Aban will proud of me and of course I feel better for my self.

How will I feel if I never accomplish this?
  I think I might be stuck at a designer job which I'm good at it but it not the best Job to do at least in Iran. I should go back to employee life and do shit.

What would my life look like if I manage to accomplish this?
  I'll have a better job, also harder. I'll make more money. I'll help my family, buy lots of stuff for them, not worry about future and jobs any more. -->
